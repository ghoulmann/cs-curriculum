To Do
------
* concrete artifacts of learning
* at collaboration and tools
* add narrative per year
* add literacy across curriculum
* add control and process input from hardware
* anchor texts
* add electronic engineering learning objectives
* add bug reporting
* add to year summary or as object of learning: effective commenting
* rewrite documentation to included technical writing curriculum objectives
* add revision tracking
* add IDE
* add OS fundamentals
* add sys admin
* read an electronic schematic diagram
* create a series circuit with DC current
* create a parallel circuit with DC current
* test a circuit
* measure resistance with ohm meter
* measure voltage with volt meter
* measure current with amp meter
* given schematic, create a circuit that senses motion, temperature, huminity, etc
* write a program that reads, processes, stores, and output data sensed from input
* use a breadboard to integrate components into circuit from schematic
* use a soldering station to integret component into circuit from schematic
