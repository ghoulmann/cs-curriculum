Problem
=======

It is not enough to equip students to access, consume, and utilize digital tools.

Mission
=======

Empower students to participate in the production of a intentionally designed, digital world through systematic and computational thinking based on authentic instruction in the complimentary fields of Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Information Technology.


Values
======
* Equity
* Contructivist pedagogy
* Literacy (reading and writing) across the curriculum
* citizenship
* Authentic learning and assessment
* Differentiated Instruction
* Collaboration
* Networked learning (production-centered; shared purpose; openly networked ([Ito]_ 74)


Assumptions
===========

Computer Science and Electrical Engineering are STEM  disciplines (science, technology, engineering, math). Computer Science and Information Technology are complementary subjects (CAS 4).

As contrast by the Computing at School Working Group in 2012,

	Computer Science is a *discipline* that seeks to understand and explore the world around us, both natural and artificial, in computational terms. Computer science is particularly, but by no means exclusively, concerned with the study, design, and implementation of computer systems, and understanding the principles underlying these designs.

	Information Technology deals with the purposeful application of computer systems to solve real-world problems, including issues such as the identification of business needs, the specification and installation of hardware and software, and the evaluation of useability. It the productive, creative and explorative use of technology. (CAS 5)


Domains
=======
Throughout the program, the student will achieve objectives in nine domains.

* Algorithms
        The student will define the term algorithm and identify authentic uses for algorithms.
* Programs
        The student will independently plan, compose, debug, and document software that addresses an authentic purpose for a user or community with something at stake.
* Data
        The student will classify, store, retrieve, manipulate, query data sources. (revise to match CAS)
* Computers
        The student will define the components of a computer system and articulate its architecture.

	Correlary Standards, Benchmarks, Objectives:

	* CompTIA (A+, Strata, Linux+ Powered by LPI) learning objectives; 
	* Cisco IT Essentials learning objectives; 
	* `McRel Benchmarks for Business Education (21 - 30) <http://www2.mcrel.org/compendium/SubjectTopics.asp?SubjectID=27>`_


* Technology and Culture
        The student will explore, interrogate, and hypothesize about causal relationships between technology and culture [to include public policy, values, economics]

 	Correlary Standards, Benchmarks, Objectives:

	* This is cultural studies.
	* `MD (MSDE) Fundamentals of Technology Curriculum <http://mdk12.org/instruction/curriculum/technology_education/index.html>`_
	* Common Core > English Language Arts Standards > Science and Technical Subjects > `Grades 9 & 10 <http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/RST/9-10>`_ 
	* Common Core > English Language Arts Standards > Science and Technical Subjects > `Grades 11 & 12 <http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/RST/11-12>`_
	* [Placeholder: Critical reading of fiction]
* Electronic Engineering
        The student will create, test, diagram, and troubleshoot electronic circuits and components.

	Correlary Standards, Benchmarks, Objectives:

	* `McRel Benchmarks for Engineering Education (Standards 1 - 4) <http://www2.mcrel.org/compendium/SubjectTopics.asp?SubjectID=28>`_
	* `MD (MSDE) Fundamentals of Technology Curriculum <http://mdk12.org/instruction/curriculum/technology_education/index.html>`_


* Post-Secondary Transition Support
        The student will explore and contrast post-secondary professional and academic opportunities.

	Correlary Standards, Benchmarks, Objectives:
	
	* `Common Core College and Career Readiness Standards <www.act.org/commoncore/pdf/FirstLook.pdf>`_ for Reading
	* `Common Core College and Career Readiness Standards <www.act.org/commoncore/pdf/FirstLook.pdf>`_ for Writing

	* `Common Core College and Career Readiness Standards <www.act.org/commoncore/pdf/FirstLook.pdf>`_ for Language

* Networks
	Understand ethernet and internet architecture and protocols; configure and administer network services for an authentic purpose. [placeholder]
