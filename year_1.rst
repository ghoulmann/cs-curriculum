*Level 2*

The student will:

* collaborate to determine a "system administrator code of conduct";
* Independently represent the collaborative process (verbally or visually);
* escalate privileges with a network OS account;
* Control read, write, execute file and directory permissions from the command line [mode];
* manage files, directories, and removeable media [ls, mount, umount, rm, rmdir];
* Differentiate command line commands, parameters, and arguments;
* manage users and groups [usermod, useradd, adduser, etc.];
* customize the user environment;
* configure the computer for remote access to the command line and graphic user interface [ssh, xrdp, vnc];
* strategically determine and set a computer hostname;
* Articulate and contrast features and use scenarios of VNC and RDP servers;
* identify the computer's unique network address from the command line (ip address, dhcp);
* Remotely access the computer and account [with ssh and rdp];
* install software using a package manager;
* manage software installation, updates, and removal;
* search for software in a repository [apt-cache search];
* create storyboards depicting personal narratives and everyday activities;
* Use the design process to create and issue direct commands to make things happen with technology;
* identify simple problems that can be solved using programmable tools, toys, or systems;
* use the design process to solve simple problems with programmable tools, toys, or systems;
