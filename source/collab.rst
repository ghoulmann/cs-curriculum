Collaborate
***********

This documentation was imagined as a product of collaboration. To facilitate collaboration, the most current draft is on github at https://github.com/ghoulmann/cs-curriculum (scroll down for the README and important information for collaborators).

Collaborating will involve making a github account, forking the repository, and having git installed on your internet-aware computer. The document is written using reStructuredText, a very handy markup syntax. I edit using an application called ReText which offers document preview; there are others around and you are sure to find one you can work with.

When you begin editing, please add your name to the LICENCE document so you receive the credit you will certainly deserve.
