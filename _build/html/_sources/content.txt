* An electric current flows throu a conductor when there is an excess of electrons at one end and a deficiency at the other end.
* Voltage is the force that moves electrons in a circuit.
* The symbol E is used to represent voltage.
* A volt is the unit for measuring voltage.
* Resistance is the opposition to current flow.
* Resistance is represented by the symbol R.
* All materials offer some resistance to current flow.
* THe resistance of a material is denpendent an the material's shape, size, and temperature.

Gates. *Introduction to Electronics*. 6th ed. (50)

* Resistors are either fixed or variable.
* The tolerance of a resistor is the amount that its resistance can vary and still be acceptable.
* Resistors are either carbon composition, wirewound, or film.
* Carbon composition resistors were the most commonly used resistors.
* Wireweod resistors are used in hugh-current circuits that must dissipate large amounts of heat.
* Film resistors offer small size with high accuracy.
* Variable resistors used to control voltage are called potentiometers.
* Variable resistors usedd to control current are called rheostats.
* Resistor values may be identifed by colored bands [articulate?].
* Resistor values of less than 100 ohms aare by a black third band.
* Resistor values of than 1 ohm are shown ba a silver third band.
* Resistor values for 1% tolerance resistors are shown with the fourth band as the multiplier.

Hardware Assumptions
============================

*Guide to Parallel Operating Systems*. Ron Carswell, Jiang and Freese.

* Virtual machine technology allows multiple operating systems to run concurrently on a single PC.

* Hardwares are the physical components of the PC system.

* The case houses and protecte the main electronic components.

* THe power supply is a sealed, metal box that contains power conversion hardware.

* THe motherboard contains the microprocessor, bus, memory, and expansion slots.

* The BIOS is firmware that suppports the PC duiring startup.

* Video and sound expansion cars permit graphical and audio communication with the user.

* Disk drive controllers allow the connection of hir drives and optical drives.
* Communications with other devices is permitted by modems, network interface cards, and wireless adapters.

* Peripherals include PC components that are connected externally to the PC.

* Preventative maintenance is the responsibility of the PC's owner.

* Many hazards can injure a PC user or damage the PC.

Software Assumptions
====================

Programs
--------

Level 1
+++++++

* Computers are controlled by sequences of instructions. (CAS)
* A computer program is like the narrative part of a story, and the computer's job is to do what the narrator says; computers have no intelligense and they forrow the narrator's instructions blindly. (CAS)
* Particular taks can be accomplished by creating a program for a computer; some computers allow their users to crete their own programs. (CAS)
* Computers typically accept inputs, follow a stored seqquence of instructions, and produce outputs. (adapted from CAS)
* Programs can include repeased instructions (CAS)

Software Fundamentals
---------------------

* Software provides instructions for hardware to follow.

* The core of a PC's operating system is the kernel, which is where hardware is secured and application serviced (Carswell).

* The OS manages resource by controllint the processory, memory, devices, storage, and user interface (Carswell).

* Modern OSs support preemptive multitasking, multithreading, and virtual memory (Carswell).

* The OS interacts with both hardware and applications (Carswell).

* The OS works with different system utilities to perform various tasks (Carswell).

* The GUI has many menus that you use to work with applications (Carswell).

* Each OS provides a method for modifying the desktop (Carswell).

* The OS and application software each provide help and support (Carswell).

* The software installation routine depends on the OS (Carswell).

File and File Systems
---------------------

* NTFS provised optins for journalizing, compression, encryption, security, auditing, and quotas (Carswell).

* Windows 7 uses the Disk Management console to manage storage areas and assign them drive letters (Carswell).

* Linux uses partiions on a hard drive to store informations (Carswell).

* By convention, Linux refers to storage areas by name and partition number (Carswell).

* Linux partitions are either automatically mounted at boot time or manually mounted as needed (Carswell).

* How a drive is mounted depends on the operating system and configuration (Carswell).

* The OS provides tools to manage file system tasks: reporting information about disk space usage, cleaning up temporary files, managing the disk space quota, and determining the firle type of the drive (Carswell).

* Directory structures can organize and maintins information in files and folders (Carswell.

* The organization of file of the directory structure is heirarchical.

* Files can be copied, moved, renamed, or deleted from the GUI or CLI.

* File content types vary.

* Extensions or header information help determine file types.

* File attributes provide information about a file's access privilieges.

* Windows 7 file attributes are archive, read-only, hidden, compression, and encryption (Carswell).

* OSs provide utilities to help locate files, including serch by type, kind, size, creation or modification date, or content.

* File compression saves disk space by removing diblicated data in files.

* Text editors may be used to create, modify, search, edit, and save files.

* Text editor search features can be used to locate or replace information quickly.

* Search-and-replace operations are especially powerful when used in conjunction with regular expressions and wildcards.

Command Line Interfaces
-----------------------

* Command line can be used to performs tasks quickly and efficiently.

* THe command interpreter is the part of an operating system that understand and executes commands entered by a human or as part of a program or script.
* Environment varieables are strings that contain information and control the behavior of various programs (Carswell).
* Each command interpreter offers methods for displaying and manipulating the contents of a file.
* Scripts and batch command files can automate repetitive directory and file-management tasks.

Algorithms
==========

Level 1
-------

* Algorithms are sets of instructions for achieving goals, made up of pre-defined steps. (CAS)
* Algorithms can br represnted in siple formats [storyboards and narrative text]. (CAS)
* Algorithms can describe everyday activities and can be followed by humand and by computers. (CAS)
*  Computers need more precise instructions than computers do. (CAS)
* Steps can be repeated. (CAS)
* Some steps may be composed of smaller steps. (CAS)

Level 2
-------

* Algorithms can be represented symbolically [flowcharts] or using instructions in a clearly defined language [turtle graphics]. (CAS)

* Algorithms can include selection and repetition [if statements and loops]. (CAS)

* Algorithms may be decompposed into component parts (procedures), each of whith itself contains an algorithm.

* Algorithms should be stated without ambiguity and care and precision are necessary to avoid errors.

* Algorithms are developed according to a plan and then tested; algorithms must be corrected if they fail these tests. (adapted from CAS)

* It can be easier to plan, test, and correct parts of an algorithm separately. (CAS)

Level 3
-------

* An algorithm is a sequence of precise steps to solve a given problem. (CAS)
* A single problem may be solved by several different algorithms. (CAS)

Level 4
-------

* The choice of an algorithm should be influenced by the data structure and data values that need to be manipulated. (CAS)

* Key algorithms [sorting and searching] should be familiar. (adapted from CAS)

* The design of algorithms inclused the avility to easily re-author, validdate, test, and correct the resulting code. (CAS)

* Different algorithms may have different performance characteristics for the same task. (CAS)
