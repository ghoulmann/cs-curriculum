Artifacts of Learning (examples)
--------------------------------

* Integrate a 1-wire environmental sensor into a computer system and log its data using an efficient and appropriate database tool. Use mathematical operators to programmatically convert celsius measurements to fahrenheit. Graph environmental sensor data over time using rrdtool, graphite, or cacti.
* Given a compatible scanner, hardware GPIO array and NOS, create a scan-to-email solution that works with a single button push. (obviate costly network scanner solution)
* Given a code base for Flesch-Kincaid readability, create an in house, cross-platform text document analyzer that assesses a writing samples grade levels based on at least three indicis/algorithms: use web/cgi solution or package for distribution using interpreted langauge.
* Develop and publish a unique Linux distribution that serves an authentic purpose or solves a real-world problem.
