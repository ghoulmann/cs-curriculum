<li>Can understand and apply the fundamental principles of computer science, including logic, algrorithms, data representation, and networks</li>
<li>Can critically articulate the individual, cultural, and societal impacts of digital technology and know how to stay safe, exploit opportunities, and manage risks (<em>Draft ICT Programme of Study</em>)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rationale">
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>This program encourages innovation, collaboration, and resourcefulness as it develops and requires logical thinking and precision. Students apply underlying principles to understand, manipulate real-world systems and to create purposeful and usable artifacts. Underlying principles, authentic practice, innovation, and invention make it both rigorous and creative. (<em>Draft ICT Programme of Study</em>)</p>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<p>Computer Science and Electronics Engineering are STEM  disciplines (science, technology, engineering, math). Computer Science and Information Technology are complementary subjects (CAS 4).</p>
<p>As contrasted by the Computing at School Working Group in 2012,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Computer Science is a <em>discipline</em> that seeks to understand and explore the world around us, both natural and artificial, in computational terms. Computer science is particularly, but by no means exclusively, concerned with the study, design, and implementation of computer systems, and understanding the principles underlying these designs.</p>
<p>Information Technology deals with the purposeful application of computer systems to solve real-world problems, including issues such as the identification of business needs, the specification and installation of hardware and software, and the evaluation of useability. It the productive, creative and explorative use of technology. (CAS 5)</p>

<div class="section" id="high-school-stem-education">
<h2>High-School STEM Education</h2>
<p>From <em>Maryland State STEM Standards of Practice Framework</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>STEM education is an approach to teaching and learning that integrates the content and skills of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. STEM Standards of Practice guide STEM instruction by defining the combination of behaviors, integrated with STEM content, which are expected of a proficient STEM student. These behaviors include engagement in inquiry, logical reasoning, collaboration, and investigation. The goal of STEM education is to prepare students for post-secondary study and the 21st century workforce.</p>
<p>STEM education removes the artificial barriers that isolate content and allows for an integrated instructional approach. The curriculum should allow students to develop life skills and apply content knowledge within a real world context. STEM education is active and focuses on a student-centered learning environment. Students engage in questioning, problem solving,collaboration, and hands-on activities while they address real life issues. In STEM education, teachers function as classroom facilitators. They guide students through the problem-solving process and plan projects that lead to mastery of content and STEM proficiency. STEM proficient students are able to answer complex questions, investigate global issues, and develop solutions for challenges and real world problems while applying the rigor of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics content in a seamless fashion. STEM proficient students are logical thinkers, effective communicators and are technologically,scientifically, and mathematically literate. (4)</p>
<p>There are two goals for STEM education in <em>high school</em>. The first goal is on the development of STEM proficient students. All students will continue to grow in their STEM proficiency as they progress from grades 9-12. Students demonstrate independence and become more focused and sophisticated in their approach to answering complex questions, investigating global issues, and developing solutions for challenges and real world problems. STEM proficient students graduate with the basic skills and knowledge required to pursue post-secondary study or work in any field.</p>
<p>The second goal for STEM education in high school is on the advanced preparation of students for post-secondary study and careers in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. High school provides a unique opportunity for students to explore different career paths and college majors through advanced coursework, career academies, magnet programs, STEM academies, specialized STEM programs, internships, and dual enrollment opportunities. Specific programs to address the needs for advanced preparation of students shall be determine by individual schools systems. (5)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This curriculum seeks to merge the boundaries of science, technology engineering and math, while connecting these subjects to arts and the humanities. Each student will explore STEM through enriching and authentic hands-on learning opportunities.</p>

<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id1">[1]</a></td><td>Connected learning is an approach to addressing inequity in education in ways geared to a networked society. It seeks to leverage the potential of digital media to expand access to learning that is socially embedded, interest-driven, and oriented toward educational, economic, or political opportunity. Connected learning is realized when a young person is able to pursue a personal interest or passion with the support of friends and caring adults, and is in turn able to link this learning and interest to academic achievement, career success or civic engagement. This model is based on evidence that the most resilient, adaptive, and effective learning involves individual interest as well as social support to overcome adversity and provide recognition (Ito). The approach knits together three crucial contexts for learning: interest-powered; peer-supported; academically oriented. In addition, it embraces these key design principles: production-centered; open networks; shared purpose.</td></tr>
