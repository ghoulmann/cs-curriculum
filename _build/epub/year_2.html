<h2>Artifacts of Learning (examples)</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Integrate a 1-wire environmental sensor into a computer system and log its data using an efficient and appropriate database tool. Use mathematical operators to programmatically convert celsius measurements to fahrenheit. Graph environmental sensor data over time using rrdtool, graphite, or cacti.</li>
