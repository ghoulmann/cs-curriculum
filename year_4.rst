Year 4
===========

All participating students have the opportunity to take qualifications [1]_ in aspects of information technology and computer science which lead to progressively higher levels of study or a professional career. Whether or not they take up this opportunity, participants will achieve the learning objectives below. (*Draft ICT Programme of Study*)

Artifacts of Learning (examples)
-----------------------------------

* Collaborate on a successful open source project: provide support, documentation, debugging, etc
* In an interpreted language, write a cross-platform application that stores and retrieves data...user interface...original application, license, documentation. Published solution.


Learning Objectives
-------------------

*Level 9*

The student will:

* independently recognise and varbally articulate similarities between complex problems and produce a general model that fits aspects of them all;
* competently and confidently use a general-purpose text-based programming language to produce efficient solutions to problems;
* Collaborate with a community of programmers to produce, debug, document a software product with a specific purpose
* Provide support for a software product
* Independently incorporate bug tracking system into workflow
* Independently maintain a well-documented and clearly licensed code repository using a revision system
* Identify characteristics of advanced data structures (b-trees, fibanachi heaps, etc)
* Create elementary graph algorithms
* Deploy course concepts in the development of an independent research project which makes a substantive scholarly contribution [Jenkins]
* Summarize and critique core theorists working in the field of New Media Literacy [Jenkins]
* Propose/submit a professional conference paper, workshop, or presentation
* Demonstrate digital media literacy skills to access, analyze, evaluate, and create digital content and social action strategies to engage and empower citizens in a diverse and participatory digital democracy.
* develop capability, creativity and knowledge in computer science, digital media, and information technology (Computing); 
* develop and apply their analytic, problem-solving, design, and computational thinking skills (Computing).

.. [1] “Qualifications” means that participating students cannot merely be offered a token course leading to nothing of value.
