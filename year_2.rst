Artifacts of Learning (examples)
--------------------------------

* Integrate a 1-wire environmental sensor into a computer system and log its data using an efficient and appropriate database tool. Use mathematical operators to programmatically convert celsius measurements to fahrenheit. Graph environmental sensor data over time using rrdtool, graphite, or cacti.
* Given a compatible scanner, hardware GPIO array and NOS, create a scan-to-email solution that works with a single button push. (obviate costly network scanner solution)
* Given a code base for Flesch-Kincaid readability, create an in house, cross-platform text document analyzer that assesses a writing samples grade levels based on at least three indicis/algorithms: use web/cgi solution or package for distribution using interpreted langauge.


Learning Objectives
-------------------

*Level 4*

The level four student will collaboratively rely on the design process to draft, test, debug, and deploy an original, short program in a text-based language that programmitcally solves an authentic problem for a user. The student will choose a license purposefully and develop appropriate clear technical documentation for a user with something at stake.

The student will:

* analyze and symbolically represent a sequence of events;
* research, write, and publish a student guide to software licensing;
* identify and classify different types of data (text; integer; decimal; instruction);
* understand the need for care and precision of syntax and typeography in given instructions;
* Enter instructions with demonstrated care and precision for syntax and typeography;
* give instructions involving selection and repetition;
* Interpret an algorithm and verbally predict an output;
* present data in a structured format suitable for processing;
* Design and implement solutions to problems by writing, running, and debugging computer programs (College Board)
* Develop and select appropriate algorithms and data structures to solve problems (College Board)
* Illustrate a process using a flowchart conventionally
* Demonstrate the use of pseudocode
* Use a soldering iron to create designed circuits based on schematics
* Strategically choose from among a variety of "divide and conquer" methods to solve recurrences
* practice probabilistic analysis of randomized algorithms

*Level 5*

The student will:

* decompose a problem into its sub-problems and make use of notation to represent it;
* analyze and present an algorithm for a given task;
* recognize the similarities between simple problems and the commonality in the algorithms used to solve them;
* explore and verbally or visually articulate the effects of changing the variables in a model or program;
* use the stages of the design process to develop, test, and refine sequences of instructions and show efficiency in framing these instructions;
* generate written verbal critiques of programs that will serve future projects;
* given a problem, manipulate strings to generate programmed verbal output;
* given a problem, select and use appropriate data types to program a solution;
* Characterize and use simple (1-dimensional) data structures.
* Code fluently in a text-based paradigm consisting of several classes and interaction objects. (College Board)
* Demonstrate familiarity with, and be able to use, standard library classes (College Board, modified)
* identify acceptable names for variables in a text-based language
* recognize and apply the symbols for mathematical operations in a text-based language
* demonstrate the use of for and while loops and
* demonstrate the use of conditionals
* Control electronic devices programmatically through GPIO and serial interfaces
* Use heapsort to sort and order statistics
* use quicksort to sort and order statistics
* sort data in linear time (?)
