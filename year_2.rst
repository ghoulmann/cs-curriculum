Level 4
-------

The student will:

* analyze and symbolically represent a sequence of events;
* identify and classify different types of data (text; integer; decimal; instruction)
* understand the need for care and precision of syntax and typeography in given instructions;
* Enter instructions with demonstrate care and precision for syntax and typeography;
* give instructions involving selection and repetition;
* Interpret an algorithm and predict an output verbally;
* present data in a structured format suitable for processing.
* Design and implement solutions to problems by writing, running, and debugging computer programs (College Board)
* Develop and select appropriate algorithms and data structures to solve problems (College Board)

Level 5
-------

The student will:

* decompose a problem into its sub-problems and make use of notation to represent it;
* analyze and present an algorithm for a given task;
* recognize the similarities between simple problems and the commonality in the algorithms used to solve them;
* explore and verbally or visually articulate the effects of changing the variables in a model or program;
* use the stages of the design process to develop, test, and refine sequences of instructions and show efficiency in framing these instructions;
* generate written verbal critiques of programs that will serve future projects;
* given a problem, manipulate strings to generate programmed verbal output;
* given a problem, select and use appropriate data types to program a solution;
* Characterize and use simple (1-dimensional) data structures.
* Code fluently in a text-based paradigm confisting of several classes and interaction objects. (College Board)
* Demonstrate familiarity with, and be able to use, standard library classes (College Board, modified)
