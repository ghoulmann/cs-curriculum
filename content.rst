Fundamentals

Gates. *Introduction to Electronics*. 6th ed. (50)

* The flow of electronis is called current. Current is represented by the symbol I.
* Ampere is represented by the symbol A.
* Current is measured in amperes.
* An electric current flows throu a conductor when there is an excess of electrons at one end and a deficiency at the other end.
* Voltage is the force that moves electrons in a circuit.
* The symbol E is used to represent voltage.
* A volt is the unit for measuring voltage.
* Resistance is the opposition to current flow.
* Resistance is represented by the symbol R.
* All materials offer some resistance to current flow.
* THe resistance of a material is denpendent an the material's shape, size, and temperature.
* Conducotrs are materials with low resistance.
* Insulators are materials with high resistance.
* Resistance is measured in ohms.
* The greek letter omega is used to represent ohms.

Resistance

Gates. *Introduction to Electronics*. 6th ed. (50)

* Resistors are either fixed or variable.
* The tolerance of a resistor is the amount that its resistance can vary and still be acceptable.
* Resistors are either carbon composition, wirewound, or film.
* Carbon composition resistors were the most commonly used resistors.
* Wireweod resistors are used in hugh-current circuits that must dissipate large amounts of heat.
* Film resistors offer small size with high accuracy.
* Variable resistors used to control voltage are called potentiometers.
* Variable resistors usedd to control current are called rheostats.
* Resistor values may be identifed by colored bands [articulate?].
* Resistor values of less than 100 ohms aare by a black third band.
* Resistor values of than 1 ohm are shown ba a silver third band.
* Resistor values for 1% tolerance resistors are shown with the fourth band as the multiplier.

Hardware Assumptions
============================

*Guide to Parallel Operating Systems*. Ron Carswell, Jiang and Freese.

* Virtual machine technology allows multiple operating systems to run concurrently on a single PC.

* Hardwares are the physical components of the PC system.

* The case houses and protecte the main electronic components.

* THe power supply is a sealed, metal box that contains power conversion hardware.

* THe motherboard contains the microprocessor, bus, memory, and expansion slots.

* The BUIS is firmware that suppports the PC duiring startup.

* Video and sound expansion cars permit graphical and audio communication with the user.

* Disk drive controllers allow the connection of hir drives and optical drives.
* Communications with other devices is permitted by modems, network interface cards, and wireless adapters.

* Peripherals include PC components that are connected externally to the PC.

* Preventative maintenance is the responsibility of the PC's owner.

* Many hazards can injure a PC user or damage the PC.
