* The flow of electronis is called current. Current is represented by the symbol I.
* Ampere is represented by the symbol A.
* Current is measured in amperes.
* An electric current flows throu a conductor when there is an excess of electrons at one end and a deficiency at the other end.
* Voltage is the force that moves electrons in a circuit.
* The symbol E is used to represent voltage.
* A volt is the unit for measuring voltage.
* Resistance is the opposition to current flow.
* Resistance is represented by the symbol R.
* All materials offer some resistance to current flow.
* THe resistance of a material is denpendent an the material's shape, size, and temperature.
* Conducotrs are materials with low resistance.
* Insulators are materials with high resistance.
* Resistance is measured in ohms.
* The greek letter omega is used to represent ohms.

Resistance

Gates. *Introduction to Electronics*. 6th ed. (50)

* Resistors are either fixed or variable.
* The tolerance of a resistor is the amount that its resistance can vary and still be acceptable.
* Resistors are either carbon composition, wirewound, or film.
* Carbon composition resistors were the most commonly used resistors.
* Wireweod resistors are used in hugh-current circuits that must dissipate large amounts of heat.
* Film resistors offer small size with high accuracy.
* Variable resistors used to control voltage are called potentiometers.
* Variable resistors usedd to control current are called rheostats.
* Resistor values may be identifed by colored bands [articulate?].
* Resistor values of less than 100 ohms aare by a black third band.
* Resistor values of than 1 ohm are shown ba a silver third band.
* Resistor values for 1% tolerance resistors are shown with the fourth band as the multiplier.

Hardware Assumptions
============================

*Guide to Parallel Operating Systems*. Ron Carswell, Jiang and Freese.

* Virtual machine technology allows multiple operating systems to run concurrently on a single PC.

* Hardwares are the physical components of the PC system.

* The case houses and protecte the main electronic components.

* THe power supply is a sealed, metal box that contains power conversion hardware.

* THe motherboard contains the microprocessor, bus, memory, and expansion slots.

* The BIOS is firmware that suppports the PC duiring startup.

* Video and sound expansion cars permit graphical and audio communication with the user.

* Disk drive controllers allow the connection of hir drives and optical drives.
* Communications with other devices is permitted by modems, network interface cards, and wireless adapters.

* Peripherals include PC components that are connected externally to the PC.

* Preventative maintenance is the responsibility of the PC's owner.

* Many hazards can injure a PC user or damage the PC.

Software Assumptions
====================

Software Fundamentals
---------------------

* Software provides instructions for hardware to follow.

* The core of a PC's operating system is the kernel, which is where hardware is secured and application serviced (Carswell).

* The OS manages resource by controllint the processory, memory, devices, storage, and user interface (Carswell).

* Modern OSs support preemptive multitasking, multithreading, and virtual memory (Carswell).

* The OS interacts with both hardware and applications (Carswell).

* The OS works with different system utilities to perform various tasks (Carswell).

* The GUI has many menus that you use to work with applications (Carswell).

* Each OS provides a method for modifying the desktop (Carswell).

* The OS and application software each provide help and support (Carswell).

* The software installation routine depends on the OS (Carswell).

File and File Systems
---------------------

* NTFS provised optins for journalizing, compression, encryption, security, auditing, and quotas (Carswell).

* Windows 7 uses the Disk Management console to manage storage areas and assign them drive letters (Carswell).

* Linux uses partiions on a hard drive to store informations (Carswell).

* By convention, Linux refers to storage areas by name and partition number (Carswell).

* Linux partitions are either automatically mounted at boot time or manually mounted as needed (Carswell).

* How a drive is mounted depends on the operating system and configuration (Carswell).

* The OS provides tools to manage file system tasks: reporting information about disk space usage, cleaning up temporary files, managing the disk space quota, and determining the firle type of the drive (Carswell).

* Directory structures can organize and maintins information in files and folders (Carswell.

* The organization of file of the directory structure is heirarchical.

* Files can be copied, moved, renamed, or deleted from the GUI or CLI.

* File content types vary.

* Extensions or header information help determine file types.

* File attributes provide information about a file's access privilieges.

* Windows 7 file attributes are archive, read-only, hidden, compression, and encryption (Carswell).

* OSs provide utilities to help locate files, including serch by type, kind, size, creation or modification date, or content.

* File compression saves disk space by removing diblicated data in files.

* Text editors may be used to create, modify, search, edit, and save files.

* Text editor search features can be used to locate or replace information quickly.

* Search-and-replace operations are especially powerful when used in conjunction with regular expressions and wildcards.

Command Line Interfaces
-----------------------

* Command line can be used to performs tasks quickly and efficiently.

* THe command interpreter is the part of an operating system that understand and executes commands entered by a human or as part of a program or script.
* Environment varieables are strings that contain information and control the behavior of various programs (Carswell).
* Each command interpreter offers methods for displaying and manipulating the contents of a file.
* Scripts and batch command files can automate repetitive directory and file-management tasks.
