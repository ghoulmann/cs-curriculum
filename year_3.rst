Learning Objectives
-------------------

*Level 6*

The student will:

* analyze, comprehend, and predict the output of complex algorithms (e.g. sorting or searching algorithms);
* Use diagrams to describe systems and their components
* fully decompose a comple problem into its sub-problems and make use of a notation to represent it
* given simple problems, recognize similarities and a model which fits some aspects of the given problems.
* use programming interfaces to make predictions and vary the rules within the programs;
* Assess and articulate the validity of a self-produced program by considering or comparing alternative solutions;
* independently write a short program that solves a problem;
* independently debug a self-composed program;
* produce programes that rely on procedures with parameters and functions returning values;
* programmatically manipulate 1-dimensional arrays;
* use and interpret 2-dimensional data structures;
* use the design process to use 2-dimensional data structures to solve a problem.
* Survey, contrast, evaluate post-secondary program types within CS/Engineering/Software Studies/Media Studies, etc;
* Survey, contrast, evaluate technology certification routes, with consideration for experience, learning objectives, career readiness;
* Evaluate technology sector job opportunities and represent the relationships between skills and marketability verbally or visually
* read and understand a large program consisting of several classes and interacting objects; read and understand a description of the design and development process leading to such a program (College Board)

*Level 7*

The student will:

* verbally and visually describe key algorithms and evaluate them for efficiency (e.g. sorting/searching parity);
* fully decompose a problem into its sub-problems and make error-free use of an appropriate notation to represent it;
* recognize and articulate similarities in complex problems and produce a model which fits some aspects of the problems;
* Rely on the design process to build a system that relies on pre-constructed models of bode;
* design and use complex data structures (including relational databases);
* select, compare, and use programming tools suited to their work in a variety of contexts;
* translate specifications expressed in natural language into the form required by a programming tool;
* Articulate and contrast the benefits and limitations of programming tools and of the results they produce;
* Given a problem, independently program a maintainable solution in a text-based language;
* Independently debug a self-produced program written in a text-based language;
* Analyze, simplify, and use complex data structures in self-produced programs.
* Prepare a resume/CV with well-suited career objective and cover letter for a specific audience and purpose.

*Level 8*

The student will:

* independently select appropriate programming constructs for specific tasks, taking into account ease of use and suitability to audience and context;
* articulate and represent similarities in complex problems and produce a model that fits most aspects of these problems;
* independently write a program for others to use;
* apply advanced debugging procedures to self-produced programs;
* use a documentation system to document usage and features of a self-produced program for others;
* normalize data structures;
* analyze and verbally represent the relationship between complex real life and the algorithm, logic and visualisations associated with programming.
